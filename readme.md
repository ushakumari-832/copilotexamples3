## Copilot Experience

This project demonstrates my experience with GitHub Copilot. I asked Copilot to generate a Python script that prints the system uptime. Copilot produced a script that works across different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and prints the uptime in a human-readable format.

### Code Generated by Copilot

The generated script, `copilot_test.py`, detects the operating system and retrieves the uptime accordingly:
- On Linux, it reads from `/proc/uptime`.
- On macOS, it uses `sysctl` to determine the boot time.
- On Windows, it parses the output of `net stats srv`.

### Modifications

I reviewed the script and made minor adjustments to improve error handling and ensure compatibility across platforms. For example, I added additional checks and formatted the output for readability.

### Testing

To test the script, I ran it on Linux and Windows machines. The output correctly displayed the system uptime in each environment.

## How to Run the Script

1. Clone this repository or download the `copilot_test.py` file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing `copilot_test.py`.
3. Run the script using Python 3:

   ```bash
   python copilot_test.py
   ```

You should see output similar to:

```
System uptime: 1 days, 4 hours, 23 minutes, 45 seconds
```

On Windows, the output will display the system uptime since a specific date and time.
